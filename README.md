# **BeeKind2Natu**

Welcome to **BeeKind2Natu**, a project I created for two main reasons:  
1. I was inspired by [deeptalks](https://github.com/benthecoder/deeptalks/blob/main/README.md) by [benthecoder](https://github.com/benthecoder).  
2. I wanted to build my first project using [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/).  



## **What is FastHTML?**  

FastHTML is an innovative framework for creating modern, interactive web apps. It's lightweight yet powerful, capable of scaling from a simple **6-line Python script** to fully-fledged production-grade apps.  

### Key Features:  
- Built-in support for authentication, databases, caching, styling, and more.  
- Extensible and easily replaceable components.  
- **1-click deployment** to platforms like Railway, Vercel, Huggingface, or any Python server (e.g., VPS, Azure, GCP, AWS).
