I build this project  for two main reasons: one, inspired by [deeptalks](https://github.com/benthecoder/deeptalks/blob/main/README.md) from [benthecoder](https://github.com/benthecoder), second for build my frist project using [fastHTML](https://fastht.ml/)

# What'ts fastHTML?

FastHTML is a new way to create modern interactive web apps. It scales down to a 6-line python file, and scales up to complex production apps. Auth, DBs, caching, styling, etc are all built-in, and replaceable and extensible. 1-click deploy is available to Railway, Vercel, Huggingface, and moreâ€”or deploy to any Python server or VPS, including Azure, GCP, and AWS.
